## Exercise 00 - Megaphone

The Goal of this exercise was to write a really simple c++ style programm, but without any classes yet, just to get familiar with the use of i.e. `std::cout`.
You enter a string and it return this string but in capital letter !

You can compile this project with `make` or `make re`.<br>
Then use it with `./megaphone "Argument_you_want_to_change_to_all_CAPS"`


## Exercise 01 - Phonebook

This subject was a little more sophisticated than the one before.<br>
First time using classes.<br>


This programm resembles a phonebook, where you can store up to 8 contacts, and display the stored information during runtime.<br>
When the programm is terminated in any way, all contacts are lost.<br>
The phonebook also has instructions and descriptive error messages that tell you what to do and how to use it correctly.


Usage:

You can compile this project with `make`, `make all` or `make re`.<br>
Then you can run it with `./phonebook`.<br>
After that, just follow the instructions of the phonebook.<br>

## Introduction

This second set of exercises is a bit more interesting. We'll be learning the basics of memory allocation in C++, references, pointers, and a rough look at switches.

## ex00. BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

This first exercise asks us to simply create a bunch of classes with basic methods we will use in future exercises in the module. We must have two ways of allocating instances of the class: either on the stack or on the heap, and free the allocated space at the right time.

### Example

This is an example output given my main.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189330417-5b804e3f-5590-4b35-8a6a-a8f53e410bb6.png">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189330643-ee7426d5-b49c-430f-a951-68b6e7969286.png">
</div>

## ex01. Moar brainz!

This second exercise consists of creating a method that will summon **N** zombies in one go, without naming each one of them. Then they all announce themselves and are properly destroyed.

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189332763-1d2836a5-2300-49a0-bdb0-57dbe5d9a3bd.png">
</div>

## ex02. HI THIS IS BRAIN

This next exercise is super simple, it only aims to differentiate between pointers and references

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189333500-6110f4ce-dbb5-4d0f-9729-49a13d47557d.png">
</div>

## ex03. Unnecessary violence

This one extends the concepts of references and pointers from the previous exercise, creating two types of humans in two classes that can attack each other with different weapons.

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189334239-fa95bba9-eaa3-41db-b834-8decbd2a3a89.png">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189334016-a97f57c5-9bdb-40a0-a076-37d5a16a1eda.png">
</div>

## ex04. Sed is for losers

This exercise aims to replicate the basic performance of the **sed** command (**s**tream **ed**itor), receiving a file and a string to replace with another. It saves the output to a file with the same name ending in *.replace*. This exercise helps us understand file streams and strings in C++.

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189335320-92e905bb-e978-4b8d-859e-d87558ec481f.png">
</div>

Note: the example above shows how the replace operation is reversible (unsurprisingly).

## ex05. Karen-Harl 2.0

The next two exercises expand on the idea of refernces a bit further. We create a **Karen/Harl** class that can give various messages of types **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **WARNING** and **ERROR**. We are asked to create that outputs the proper message depending message type.

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189336182-7321ad3f-8c24-40ad-8a80-de48ab11da1e.png">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189335932-cc2a47f6-d0b1-4030-93ca-e714a4a2d6ab.png">
</div>

You can compile this project with `make` or `make re`.<br>
Then use it with `./Harl`

## ex06. Karen-Harl-filter

This last exercise is an extension of the previous one. However this time we receive the message type from the user and output that type's message and all the message types above it (order is **DEBUG** < **INFO** < **WARNING** < **ERROR**). We must coordinate the responses using switches for this exercise.
So you need to use a "switch" for two reason, first to don't use a forest of (if, else if, else) and second for execute all function below the good one !

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189337035-d77110f1-0bc6-4071-bb6c-249054d99982.png">
</div>

Note how the **DEBUG** message is not shown because it is below **INFO**.

You can compile this project with `make` or `make re`.<br>
Then use it with `./Harl "Argument_you_want_between_INFO_DEBUG_ERROR_WARNING"`


### --------------------------------------PROJECT 02--------------------------------------

## Ex00 - Fixed Class
Because floating point types lack accuracy and can be slow, we must implement a new class for Fixed point numbers. This exercise is an introduction to the Orthodox Canonical form, in which a class should have a default constructor, a copy constructor, a destructor and an assignment operator overload.

```
./fixed
```

The output shows the sequence of calls to constructors, destructors, assignment operators and getters.

## Ex01 - A More Useful Fixed Class
This exercise builds on the previous one. Now we must add an output stream overload to the class, as well as new constructors from int and float and member functions able to translate a Fixed number into an integer or a float.

```
./fixed
```

## Ex02 - Overload Madness
The third exercise, again, builds on the previous one. Now we must implement overloads for all operators (comparison < > <= >= == !=, binary + - * /, unary prefix++ ++postfix prefix-- postfix--) as well as regular and const versions of functions that return the largest or smallest of two fixed numbers.

```
./fixed
```


### --------------------------------------PROJECT 03--------------------------------------

## Ex00 - ClapTrap
In the first exercise, we must implement a simple class, ClapTrap, which has the ability to attack, take damage and be repaired. The class also has private attributes: a name, hit points, energy points and attack damage.

```
./trap
```
The output shows the results of a functionality test.

## Ex01 - ScavTrap
The second exercise builds on the first by implementing another class, ScavTrap, which inherits from the previously created ClapTrap class and implements some new functionality, guardGate. ScavTrap also has different default values in its hit points, energy points and attack damage attributes.

```
./trap
```

## Ex02 - FragTrap
The third exercise introduces yet another class, FragTrap, which also inherits from the ClapTrap class and also has its own functionality, highFivesGuys. FragTrap also has different default values in its hit points, energy points and attack damage attributes compared to both ClapTrap and ScavTrap.

```
./trap
```

The output displays the numbers sorted with a vector and a list, as well as the number of clock cycles each sort took to complete.
